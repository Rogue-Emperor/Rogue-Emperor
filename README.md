# 🌌 The Rogue Emperor | Innovator & Entrepreneur

> "Conquering the intersection of the Space Era and Quantum Finance."

I am a builder of ecosystems and a pioneer of digital frontiers. From architecting open-source communities to mastering game engine physics, my mission is to scale technology beyond Earth's orbit and into the high-frequency world of quantitative systems.

### 🚀 Git Mastery: Command Center

To ensure your GitHub repository stays perfectly in sync with this environment:

#### 1. Push Local Changes to GitHub
Use this when you've finished making changes here and want them to appear on your live GitHub repo.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Pull Changes from GitHub
Use this if you edited the README or any other file directly on the GitHub website and want those changes here.
```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### 3. Overwrite GitHub with Local (Force Push)
Use this if GitHub is out of sync or has "divergent branches" and you want to **force** GitHub to match exactly what you see here. **Warning: This overwrites GitHub.**
```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

#### 4. Delete All Other Local Branches
If you have created other branches locally and want to clean them up, keeping only `main`:
```bash
git branch | grep -v "main" | xargs git branch -D
```

#### 5. Delete Other Remote Branches (On GitHub)
To see all remote branches: `git branch -r`. To delete a specific branch on GitHub:
```bash
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

### 🎨 Customization Notes

#### Favicon & Static Assets
To update your favicon, place an `icon.png` file inside the `public/` directory (located at the root of the project). The application is already configured to look for this file as your primary site icon in `src/app/layout.tsx`.
